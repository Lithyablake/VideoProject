# VideoProject
Recolection of music videos featuring themes, songwriters and lyrics from latin-american politial protest movements. 

## Technical info
JavaScript (ECMASscript6+) project for a video-display platform, full responsive. This project will use, but not heavily, HTML5 and CSS.

## Used commands: 
- `npm i -D live-server` to run the live server

## Video References: 
These videos were gathered for educational and training purposes. They are meant to be ignored on all commits of the repo except for the final go. (Wait for it) 

## Credit where it is due
This project is passible thanks to the courses at Platzi, and its amazing teachers @teffcode, @gndx, and @sparragus, among many others.
